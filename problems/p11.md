11. Showing only the Date with a DateTime field
    In the output of the query above, showing the Employees in order of BirthDate, we see the time of the BirthDate field, which we donâ€™t want. Show only the date portion of the BirthDate field.

sol:

```sql
select first_name, last_name, title, date(birth_date) as birth_date
from employees
order by birth_date;
```
