25. High freight charges
    
    Some of the countries we ship to have very high
    freight charges. We'd like to investigate some more
    shipping options for our customers, to be able to offer
    them lower freight charges. Return the three ship
    countries with the highest average freight overall, in
    descending order by average freight.

sol:

```SQL
select ship_country, avg(freight) as average_freight 
from orders
group by ship_country
order by average_freight desc
limit 3;
```
