10. Employees, in order of age

    For all the employees in the Employees table, show the FirstName, LastName, Title, and BirthDate. Order the results by BirthDate, so we have the oldest employees first.

sol:
    
```sql
select first_name, last_name, title, birth_date
from employees
order by birth_date;
```
