19. Orders and the Shipper that was used

    We’d like to show a list of the Orders that were made, including the Shipper that was used. Show the OrderID, OrderDate (date only), and CompanyName of the Shipper, and sort by OrderID. In order to not show all the orders (there’s more than 800), show only those rows with an OrderID of less than 10300.

sol:

```sql
select order_id, order_date, company_name
from orders
join shippers
	on orders.ship_via = shippers.shipper_id
where order_id < 10300
order by order_id;
```
