17. Contact titles for customers

    Show a list of all the different values in the Customers table for ContactTitles. Also include a count for each ContactTitle. This is similar in concept to the previous question “Countries where there are customers”, except we now want a count for each ContactTitle.

sol:

```sql
select contact_title, count(contact_title) as total_contact_title
from customers
group by contact_title ;
```
