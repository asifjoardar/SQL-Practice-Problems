36. Orders with many line items

    The Northwind mobile app developers are testing an
    app that customers will use to show orders. In order
    to make sure that even the largest orders will show up
    correctly on the app, they'd like some samples of
    orders that have lots of individual line items. Show
    the 10 orders with the most line items, in order of
    total line items.

sol:

```sql
select
	orders.order_id,
	count(orders.order_id) as total_order_details
from orders
inner join order_details
	on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
group by orders.order_id
order by total_order_details desc
limit 10;
```
