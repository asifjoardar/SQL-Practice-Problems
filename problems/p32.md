32. High-value customers
    
    We want to send all of our high-value customers a
    special VIP gift. We're defining high-value customers
    as those who've made at least 1 order with a total
    value (not including the discount) equal to $10,000 or
    more. We only want to consider orders made in the
    year 2016.

sol:

```SQL
select 
	customers.customer_id,
	customers.company_name,
	orders.order_id,
	sum(order_details.quantity * order_details.unit_price) as total_order_amount
from customers
inner join orders
	on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
inner join order_details
	on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
where orders.order_date >= '19970101' and orders.order_date < '19980101'
group by
	customers.customer_id,
	customers.company_name,
	orders.order_id
having sum(order_details.quantity * order_details.unit_price) >= 10000
order by customers.customer_id, orders.order_id;
```
