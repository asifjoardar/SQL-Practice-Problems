13. OrderDetails amount per line item
    In the OrderDetails table, we have the fields UnitPrice and Quantity. Create a new field, TotalPrice, that multiplies these two together. Weâ€™ll ignore the Discount field for now.
    In addition, show the OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice, and Quantity. Order by OrderID and ProductID.

sol:

```sql
select order_id, product_id, unit_price, quantity, (unit_price * quantity) as total_price
from order_details
order by order_id , product_id ;
```
