4. Sales Representatives in the United States

   Now weâ€™d like to see the same columns as above, but only for those employees that both have the title of Sales Representative, and also are in the United States.

   sol:

   ```sql
   select first_name, last_name, hire_date
   from employees
   where Title = 'Sales Representative' and country = 'USA' ;
   ```
