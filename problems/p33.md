33. High-value customers - total orders

    The manager has changed his mind. Instead of
    requiring that customers have at least one individual
    orders totaling $10,000 or more, he wants to define
    high-value customers as those who have orders
    totaling $15,000 or more in 2016. How would you
    change the answer to the problem above?

sol:

```sql
select 
	customers.customer_id,
	customers.company_name,
	sum(order_details.quantity * order_details.unit_price) as total_order_amount
from customers
inner join orders
	on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
inner join order_details
	on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
where orders.order_date >= '19970101' and orders.order_date < '19980101'
group by
	customers.customer_id,
	customers.company_name
having sum(order_details.quantity * order_details.unit_price) >= 15000
order by customers.customer_id;
```
