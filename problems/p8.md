8. Orders shipping to France or Belgium

   Looking at the Orders table, there’s a field called ShipCountry. Write a query that shows the OrderID, CustomerID, and ShipCountry for the orders where the ShipCountry is either France or Belgium.

   sol:
   ```sql
   select order_id, customer_id, ship_country
   from orders o
   where ship_country = 'France' or ship_country = 'Belgium' ;
   ```
