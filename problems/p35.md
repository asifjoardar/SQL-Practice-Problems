35. Month-end orders

    At the end of the month, salespeople are likely to try
    much harder to get orders, to meet their month-end
    quotas. Show all orders made on the last day of the
    month. Order by EmployeeID and OrderID

sol:

```sql
select 
	employees.employee_id,
	orders.order_id,
	orders.order_date
from employees
inner join orders
	on orders.employee_id = employees.employee_id
where orders.order_date = date_trunc('month', orders.order_date) + interval '1 month - 1 day' 
order by
	employees.employee_id,
	orders.order_id;
```
