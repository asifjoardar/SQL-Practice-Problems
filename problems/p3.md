3. Sales Representatives
   
   We’d like to see just the FirstName, LastName, and HireDate of all the employees with the Title of Sales Representative. Write a SQL statement that returns only those employees.

sol:
```sql
select first_name, last_name, hire_date
from employees
where Title = 'Sales Representative';
```
