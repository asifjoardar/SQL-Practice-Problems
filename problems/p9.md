9. Orders shipping to any country in Latin America

   Now, instead of just wanting to return all the orders from France of Belgium, we want to show all the orders from any Latin American country. But we don’t have a list of Latin American countries in a table in the Northwind database. So, we’re going to just use this list of Latin American countries that happen to be in the Orders table:
   Brazil
   Mexico
   Argentina
   Venezuela
   It doesn’t make sense to use multiple Or statements anymore, it would get too convoluted. Use the In statement.

sol:

```sql
select order_id, customer_id, ship_country
from orders o 
where ship_country in ('Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Argentina', 'Venezuela') ;
```
