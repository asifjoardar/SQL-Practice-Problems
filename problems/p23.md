23. Products that need reordering, continued

    Now we need to incorporate these fields—
    UnitsInStock, UnitsOnOrder, ReorderLevel,
    Discontinued—into our calculation. We’ll define
    “products that need reordering” with the following:
    UnitsInStock plus UnitsOnOrder are less than
    or equal to ReorderLevel
    The Discontinued flag is false (0).

sol:

```SQL
select product_id, product_name, units_in_stock, units_on_order, reorder_level, discontinued
from products
where units_in_stock + units_on_order <= reorder_level and discontinued = 0
order by product_id;
```
