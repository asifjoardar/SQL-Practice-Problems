42. Late orders - which employees?

    Some salespeople have more orders arriving late than
    others. Maybe they're not following up on the order
    process, and need more training. Which salespeople
    have the most orders arriving late?

sol:

```sql
select
    orders.employee_id,
    employees.last_name,
    count(orders.employee_id) as total_late_orders
from orders
join employees on orders.employee_id = employees.employee_id
where orders.required_date <= orders.shipped_date
group by orders.employee_id, employees.last_name
order by total_late_orders desc;
```
