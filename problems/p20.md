20. Categories, and the total products in each category

    For this problem, weâ€™d like to see the total number of products in each
    category. Sort the results by the total number of products, in descending
    order.

sol:

```SQL
select category_name, count(category_name)  as total_product 
from categories
inner join products
	on categories.category_id = products.category_id
group by category_name
order by total_product desc;
```
