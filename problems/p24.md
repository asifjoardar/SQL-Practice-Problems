24. Customer list by region

    A salesperson for Northwind is going on a business
    trip to visit customers, and would like to see a list of
    all customers, sorted by region, alphabetically.
    However, he wants the customers with no region
    (null in the Region field) to be at the end, instead of
    at the top, where youâ€™d normally find the null values.
    Within the same region, companies should be sorted
    by CustomerID.

sol:

```SQL
select customer_id, company_name, region
from customers
order by 
	(case 
		when region is null then 1
		else 0
	end),
	region, customer_id;
```

```SQL
select customer_id, company_name, region,
	case
		when region is null then 1
		else 0
	end as region_order
from customers
order by region_order, region, customer_id;
```
