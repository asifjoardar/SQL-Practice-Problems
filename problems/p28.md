28. High freight charges - last year
    
    We're continuing to work on high freight charges. We
    now want to get the three ship countries with the
    highest average freight charges. But instead of
    filtering for a particular year, we want to use the last
    12 months of order data, using as the end date the last
    OrderDate in Orders.

sol:

```SQL
select 
	ship_country, avg(freight) as average_freight 
from 
	orders
where 
	order_date >= (select max(order_date) - interval '1 year' from orders) 
group by
	ship_country
order by
	average_freight desc
limit 3;
```
