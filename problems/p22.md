22. Products that need reordering

    What products do we have in our inventory that
    should be reordered? For now, just use the fields
    UnitsInStock and ReorderLevel, where UnitsInStock
    is less than the ReorderLevel, ignoring the fields
    UnitsOnOrder and Discontinued.
    Order the results by ProductID.

sol:

```SQL
select product_id, product_name, units_in_stock, reorder_level
from products
where units_in_stock < reorder_level
order by product_id;
```
