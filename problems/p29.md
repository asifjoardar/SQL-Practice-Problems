29. Inventory list
    
    We're doing inventory, and need to show information
    like the below, for all orders. Sort by OrderID and
    Product ID.

sol:

```sql
select
	employees.employee_id,
	employees.last_name,
	orders.order_id,
	products.product_name,
	order_details.quantity
from employees
	join orders
		on employees.employee_id = orders.employee_id
	join order_details
		on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
	join products
		on products.product_id = order_details.product_id
order by
	orders.order_id,
	products.product_id;
```
