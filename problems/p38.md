38. Orders - accidental double-entry

    Janet Leverling, one of the salespeople, has come to
    you with a request. She thinks that she accidentally
    double-entered a line item on an order, with a
    different ProductID, but the same quantity. She
    remembers that the quantity was 60 or more. Show
    all the OrderIDs with line items that match this, in
    order of OrderID.

sol:

```sql
select 
	order_id
from order_details
where quantity >= 60
group by
	order_id,
	quantity
having count(quantity) > 1;
```
